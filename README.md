# Library

## Introduction

This project is a virtual library where the user can store book details such as title, author, number of pages, and reading status. The stored books can be sorted based on their reading status. 

## Goals and Objectives

* Create library UI
* Allow user to add and delete books
* Allow user to change the reading status of books
* Allow user to sort the books based on their reading status

## How it works

The user will be given an empty shelf. An add button can be found at the bottom right of the screen. If clicked, the user will get a form where the title, author, pages, and read status of the book can be inputted. A card will appear on the shelf if a book is successfully added. On the bottom of the card, a toggle and delete button can be found. To alter the reading status, the toggle button must be clicked. The delete button deletes a book from the library if clicked.

## Thoughts After Completion

This project gave me a lot of headache from start to finish. Every step of the way feels like a dead-end and I had to back away to arrive at a solution. This made me realize how important it really is to plan ahead and know what your wanted outputs are. Overall, it was really frustrating but rewarding once I was done with it.
